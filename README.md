100% AI generated code.  Bones from GROK, additional features and polish from Gemini.  Consider this (basically) instantly abandoned, do what you want with the code.

If the exe doesn't work you might need to install pynput manually or something, I don't know.

This program tracks mouse input and displays movement as lines and mouse down and up inputs as dots.  The line/dot size and colors are configurable and save to a text file.  There are 3 different modes, a smooth shrinking/fading line, a basic vanilla vanishing line, and a fading jaggy line that looks a bit different than the smooth fade.

Couldn't quite nail down the look of the smooth fade, it erases lines where they intersect.
